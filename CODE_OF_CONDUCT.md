 **Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct**

Effective: June 29, 2023 Last Updated: June 21, 2023 

![🔹]

 **Our Pledge** We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, caste, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community. 

![🔹]

**Enforcement Responsibilities** Community and Holo leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. Community and Holo leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate. This project is a collaboration between the community of Holo stakeholders and Holo Ltd. At times, some conflicts might necessitate wider engagement of the leaders of Holo Ltd beyond the confines of this project. The Holo leadership can revoke the level of community access based on their behavior, contribution to the community, and adherence to the Code of Conduct. Holo team members can be contacted directly with any complaint that arises.

**Scope** This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
