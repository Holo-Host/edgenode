### Come to Holo Huddles

anything you feel like you want to contribute. Just being there is enough!

You can find out more about our Holo Huddles [here](https://forum.holo.host/t/regular-holo-huddle-holo-forge-calls-with-rob/7713). You don‚Äôt have to turn on

## Find an Issue

We have good first issues for new contributors and help wanted issues suitable
for any contributor. [good first issue](https://github.com/Holo-Host/edgenode/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22) has extra information to
help you make your first contribution. [help wanted](https://github.com/Holo-Host/edgenode/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22help%20wanted%22) are issues
suitable for someone who isn't a core maintainer and is good to move onto after
your first pull request.

Sometimes there won‚Äôt be any issues with these labels. That‚Äôs ok! There is
likely still something for you to work on. If you want to contribute but you
don‚Äôt know where to start or can't find a suitable issue, you can [submit an issue](https://github.com/Holo-Host/edgenode/issues/new) introducing yourself with your skillsets and interests so we can find a good fit for you.

Once you see an issue that you'd like to work on, please use the [contributeToIssue](https://github.com/Holo-Host/edgenode/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3AcontributeToIssue) label to indicate your interest.

## Ask for Help

The best way to reach us with a question when contributing is to ask on:

* The original github issue

## Pull Request Lifecycle

- Please comment on an existing issue or create a new one to let us know what it is you want to work on and outline your proposed solution, so we can ensure your pull request will match the requirements for our project.
- Fork the repo, and submit a pull request when you are ready.
- We will review the pull request and may ask for revisions before we approve it.
- Once we approve it, we will merge the pull request.

## Pull Request Checklist

When you submit your pull request, or you push new commits to it, our automated
systems will run some checks on your new code. We require that your pull request
passes these checks, but we also have more criteria than just that before we can
accept and merge it. We recommend that you check the following things locally
before you submit your code:
